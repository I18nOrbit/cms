## Stack notes

This project is designed to be open-source and self-hosted.

For this reason, I opted for a more opinionated backend; one that would remain relatively stable over time. (Sorry Rails, but I prefer TS)

As for the frontend, while I personally find Angular to be superior, I've chosen React. This decision is driven by my desire to mentor newcomers on a real project. React's simpler complexity and strong market presence should enable them to acquire skills more quickly and enhance their employability.
